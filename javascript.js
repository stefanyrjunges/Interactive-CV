        <hr>
        <b><i>The year was 2012</b></i>. After browsing Tumblr for hours, 12-year-old me decided to dive into the world of HTML and CSS, which was a hobby for many young girls at the time. I didn't know what IT was - I didn't even know exactly what I was doing with all that code in front of me. But I knew I loved to develop, innovate and create, and that's exactly what I did for most of my teenage years: created user-focused websites for other Tumblr and Blogspot enthusiasts and shared tools so they could develop their own pages! From the desire to help and expand this idea, <b><i>HTMLForAll</b></i> was born, an initiative to make web development more accessible to underrepresented groups in tech such as women and the LGBTQ+ community.
        <br>
        Life led me to a very different path and at the age of 17, I decided to go to <b><i>Law School</b></i>, where I developed many skills and abilities that follow me into my everyday life, like how to communicate effectively, analyse complex situations and solve a variety of problems, assess risks and manage projects with large teams.
        <br>
        At the age of 21, I faced the biggest result of my ambitions, <b><i>passing the Bar on first attempt while still in college</b></i>. I then graduated at 22, and another very different path was put ahead of me: moving to Ireland from Brazil, diving into a different culture and starting to study Computing in a second language, which I realised has always been my passion!

        <br><br>
        <div class="sectionTitle">Challenges</div>
        <b><i>Balancing high caseload with quality of service</b></i>: as part of a legal aid service, the volume of clients made it challenging to maintain thorough support for each case.
        <br>
        <i>Solution</i>: developed time-saving workflows, prioritized based on urgency and complexity, and used checklists to ensure no detail was missed.

        <br>
        <b><i>Communicating legal processes to non-experts</b></i>: many clients had no legal background, making it difficult for them to understand procedures and expectations.
        <br>
        <i>Solution</i>: practiced clear, jargon-free communication and used visual aids or step-by-step explanations.
